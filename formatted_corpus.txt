tries again and again to kill snowwhite
snowwhite and the seven dwarfs
it was the middle of winter
and the snowflakes were falling like feathers from the sky
and a queen sat at her window working
and her embroideryframe was of ebony
and as she worked
gazing at times out on the snow
she pricked her finger
and there fell from it three drops of blood on the snow
and when she saw how bright and red it looked
she said to herself
oh that i had a child as white as snow
as red as blood
and as black as the wood of the embroidery frame not very long after she had a daughter
with a skin as white as snow
lips as red as blood
and hair as black as ebony
and she was named snowwhite
and when she was born the queen died
after a year had gone by the king took another wife
a beautiful woman
but proud and overbearing
and she could not bear to be surpassed in beauty by any one
she had a magic lookingglass
and she used to stand before it
and look in it
and say
looking glass upon the wall
who is fairest of us all
and the lookingglass would answer
you are fairest of them all
and she was contented
for she knew that the lookingglass spoke the truth
now
snowwhite was growing prettier and prettier
and when she was seven years old she was as beautiful as day
far more so than the queen herself
so one day when the queen went to her mirror and said
lookingglass upon the wall
who is fairest of us all

it answered
queen
you are full fair
‘tis true
but snowwhite fairer is than you
this gave the queen a great shock
and she became yellow and green with envy
and from that hour her heart turned against snowwhite
and she hated her
and envy and pride like ill weeds grew in her heart higher every day
until she had no peace day or night
at last she sent for a huntsman
and said
take the child out into the woods
so that i may set eyes on her no more
you must put her to death
and bring me her heart for a token
the huntsman consented
and led her away
but when he drew his cutlass to pierce snowwill innocent heart
she began to weep
and to say
oh
dear huntsman
do not take my life
i will go away into the wild wood
and never come home again and as she was so lovely the huntsman had pity on her
and said
away with you then
poor child
for he thought the wild animals would be sure to devour her
and it was as if a stone had been rolled away from his heart when he did not put her to death
just at that moment a young wild boar came running by
so he caught and killed it
and taking out its heart
he brought it to the queen for a token
and it was salted and cooked
and the wicked woman ate it up
thinking that there was an end of snowwhite
now
when the poor child found herself quite alone in the wild woods
she felt full of terror
even of the very leaves on the trees
and she did not know what to do for fright
then she began to run over the sharp stones and through the thorn bushes
and the wild beasts after her
but they did her no harm
she ran as long as her feet would carry her
and when the evening drew near she came to a little house
and she went inside to rest
everything there was very small
but as pretty and clean as possible
there stood the little table ready laid
and covered with a white cloth
and seven little plates
and seven knives and forks
and drinkingcups
by the wall stood seven little beds
side by side
covered with clean white quilts
snowwhite
being very hungry and thirsty
ate from each plate a little porridge and bread
and drank out of each little cup a drop of wine
so as not to finish up one portion alone
after that she felt so tired that she lay down on one of the beds
but it did not seem to suit her
one was too long
another too short
but at last the seventh was quite right
and so she lay down upon it
committed herself to heaven
and fell asleep

when it was quite dark
the masters of the house came home
they were seven dwarfs
whose occupation was to dig underground among the mountains
when they had lighted their seven candles
and it was quite light in the little house
they saw that some one must have been in
as everything was not in the same order in which they left it
the first said
who has been sitting in my little chair the second said
who has been eating from my little plate the third said
who has been taking my little loaf the fourth said
who has been tasting my porridge the fifth said
who has been using my little fork the sixth said
who has been cutting with my little knife the seventh said
who has been drinking from my little cup
then the first one
looking round
saw a hollow in his bed
and cried
who has been lying on my bed and the others came running
and cried
some one has been on our beds too but when the seventh looked at his bed
he saw little snowwhite lying there asleep
then he told the others
who came running up
crying out in their astonishment
and holding up their seven little candles to throw a light upon snowwhite
o goodness
o gracious cried they
what beautiful child is this and were so full of joy to see her that they did not wake her
but let her sleep on
and the seventh dwarf slept with his comrades
an hour at a time with each
until the night had passed
when it was morning
and snowwhite awoke and saw the seven dwarfs
she was very frightened
but they seemed quite friendly
and asked her what her name was
and she told them
and then they asked how she came to be in their house
and she related to them how her stepmother had wished her to be put to death
and how the huntsman had spared her life
and how she had run the whole day long
until at last she had found their little house
then the dwarfs said
if you will keep our house for us
and cook
and wash
and make the beds
and sew and knit
and keep everything tidy and clean
you may stay with us
and you shall lack nothing
with all my heart said snowwhite
and so she stayed
and kept the house in good order
in the morning the dwarfs went to the mountain to dig for gold
in the evening they came home
and their supper had to be ready for them
all the day long the maiden was left alone
and the good little dwarfs warned her
saying
beware

of your stepmother
she will soon know you are here
let no one into the house now the queen
having eaten snowwill heart
as she supposed
felt quite sure that now she was the first and fairest
and so she came to her mirror
and said
lookingglass upon the wall
who is fairest of us all
and the glass answered
queen
thou art of beauty rare
but snowwhite living in the glen with the seven little men is a thousand times more fair
then she was very angry
for the glass always spoke the truth
and she knew that the huntsman must have deceived her
and that snowwhite must still be living
and she thought and thought how she could manage to make an end of her
for as long as she was not the fairest in the land
envy left her no rest
at last she thought of a plan
she painted her face and dressed herself like an old peddler woman
so that no one would have known her
in this disguise she went across the seven mountains
until she came to the house of the seven little dwarfs
and she knocked at the door and cried
fine wares to sell
fine wares to sell snowwhite peeped out of the window and cried
goodday
good woman
what have you to sell good wares
fine wares answered she
laces of all colors
and she held up a piece that was woven of variegated silk
i need not be afraid of letting in this good woman thought snowwhite
and she unbarred the door and bought the pretty lace
what a figure you are
child said the old woman
come and let me lace you properly for once snowwhite
suspecting nothing
stood up before her
and let her lace her with the new lace
but the old woman laced so quickly and tightly that it took will breath away
and she fell down as dead
now you have done with being the fairest said the old woman as she hastened away
not long after that
towards evening
the seven dwarfs came home
and were terrified to see their dear snowwhite lying on the ground
without life or motion
they raised her up
and when they saw how tightly she was laced they cut the lace in two
then she began to draw breath
and little by little she returned to life
when the dwarfs heard what had happened they said
the old peddler woman was no other than the wicked queen
you must beware of letting any one in when we are not here and when the wicked woman got home she went to her glass and said
looking glass against the wall
who is fairest of us all

and it answered as before
queen
thou art of beauty rare
but snowwhite living in the glen with the seven little men is a thousand times more fair
when she heard that she was so struck with surprise that all the blood left her heart
for she knew that snowwhite must still be living
but now said she
i will think of something that will be her ruin and by witchcraft she made a poisoned comb
then she dressed herself up to look like another different sort of old woman
so she went across the seven mountains and came to the house of the seven dwarfs
and knocked at the door and cried
good wares to sell
good wares to sell snowwhite looked out and said
go away
i must not let anybody in but you are not forbidden to look said the old woman
taking out the poisoned comb and holding it up
it pleased the poor child so much that she was tempted to open the door
and when the bargain was made the old woman said
now
for once
your hair shall be properly combed poor snowwhite
thinking no harm
let the old woman do as she would
but no sooner was the comb put in her hair than the poison began to work
and the poor girl fell down senseless
now
you paragon of beauty said the wicked woman
this is the end of you and went off
by good luck it was now near evening
and the seven little dwarfs came home
when they saw snowwhite lying on the ground as dead
they thought directly that it was the stepwill doing
and looked about
found the poisoned comb
and no sooner had they drawn it out of her hair than snowwhite came to herself
and related all that had passed
then they warned her once more to be on her guard
and never again to let any one in at the door
and the queen went home and stood before the lookingglass and said
lookingglass against the wall
who is fairest of us all
and the lookingglass answered as before
queen
thou art of beauty rare
but snowwhite living in the glen with the seven little men is a thousand times more fair
when she heard the lookingglass speak thus she trembled and shook with anger
snowwhite shall die cried she
though it should cost me my own life and then she went to a secret lonely chamber
where no one was likely to come
and there she made a poisonous apple
it was beautiful to look upon
being white with red cheeks
so that any one who should see it must long for it
but whoever ate even a little bit of it must die
when the apple was ready she painted her face and clothed herself like a peasant woman
and went across the seven mountains to where the seven

dwarfs lived
and when she knocked at the door snowwhite put her head out of the window and said
i dare not let anybody in
the seven dwarfs told me not to all right answered the woman
i can easily get rid of my apples elsewhere
there
i will give you one no answered snowwhite
i dare not take anything
are you afraid of poison said the woman
look here
i will cut the apple in two pieces
you shall have the red side
i will have the white one for the apple was so cunningly made
that all the poison was in the rosy half of it
snowwhite longed for the beautiful apple
and as she saw the peasant woman eating a piece of it she could no longer refrain
but stretched out her hand and took the poisoned half
but no sooner had she taken a morsel of it into her mouth than she fell to the earth as dead
and the queen
casting on her a terrible glance
laughed aloud and cried
as white as snow
as red as blood
as black as ebony
this time the dwarfs will not be able to bring you to life again and when she went home and asked the lookingglass
lookingglass against the wall
who is fairest of us all at last it answered
you are the fairest now of all then her envious heart had peace
as much as an envious heart can have
the dwarfs
when they came home in the evening
found snow white lying on the ground
and there came no breath out of her mouth
and she was dead
they lifted her up
sought if anything poisonous was to be found
cut her laces
combed her hair
washed her with water and wine
but all was of no avail
the poor child was dead
and remained dead
then they laid her on a bier
and sat all seven of them round it
and wept and lamented three whole days
and then they would have buried her
but that she looked still as if she were living
with her beautiful blooming cheeks
so they said
we cannot hide her away in the black ground and they had made a coffin of clear glass
so as to be looked into from all sides
and they laid her in it
and wrote in golden letters upon it her name
and that she was a will daughter
then they set the coffin out upon the mountain
and one of them always remained by it to watch
and the birds came too
and mourned for snow white
first an owl
then a raven
and lastly
a dove
now
for a long while snowwhite lay in the coffin and never changed
but looked as if she were asleep
for she was still as white as snow
as red as blood
and her hair was as black as ebony

it happened
however
that one day a will son rode through the wood and up to the dwarfs’ house
which was near it
he saw on the mountain the coffin
and beautiful snowwhite within it
and he read what was written in golden letters upon it
then he said to the dwarfs
let me have the coffin
and i will give you whatever you like to ask for it but the dwarfs told him that they could not part with it for all the gold in the world
but he said
i beseech you to give it me
for i cannot live without looking upon snow white
if you consent i will bring you to great honor
and care for you as if you were my brethren
when he so spoke the good little dwarfs had pity upon him and gave him the coffin
and the will son called his servants and bid them carry it away on their shoulders
now it happened that as they were going along they stumbled over a bush
and with the shaking the bit of poisoned apple flew out of her throat
it was not long before she opened her eyes
threw up the cover of the coffin
and sat up
alive and well
oh dear
where am i cried she
the will son answered
full of joy
you are near me and
relating all that had happened
he said
i would rather have you than anything in the world
come with me to my will castle and you shall be my bride and snowwhite was kind
and went with him
and their wedding was held with pomp and great splendor
but snowwill wicked stepmother was also bidden to the feast
and when she had dressed herself in beautiful clothes she went to her lookingglass and said
lookingglass upon the wall
who is fairest of us all
the lookingglass answered
o queen
although you are of beauty rare
the young bride is a thousand times more fair
then she railed and cursed
and was beside herself with disappointment and anger
first she thought she would not go to the wedding
but then she felt she should have no peace until she went and saw the bride
and when she saw her she knew her for snowwhite
and could not stir from the place for anger and terror
for they had ready redhot iron shoes
in which she had to dance until she fell down dead
the end
